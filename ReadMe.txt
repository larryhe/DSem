Implemented all the semantics defined in the source code templates outlined as following: 
    * evaluate a number or boolean expression
    * evaluate the sum of two numbers
    * evaluate the product of two numbers
    * evaluate less-than expression
    * evaluate not expression
    * execute assign command
    * execute let-in command
    * execute if-then-else command
    * execute while-do command
    * added all the test cases for above semantics implementation
